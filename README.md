## Tools
Don't spend time deciding what to use. Focus on what you're building.

* **Text editor** : [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). They also have a web editor now (<https://vscode.dev>)
* **Theme** : "VS Code dark+" or "One Dark" (which also has "One Light")
* **Font** : 'Hack' for code. 'Consolas' for most other things. 
[Meslolgs Nerd Font](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font) for your terminal or 'Ubuntu Mono'.
* **Hosting static content** : GitHub pages (repository settings > pages) + GitHub actions.  
  (GitLab works too, especially if you want to keep your repo private)
* **Online IDE** : [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) Easy setup if you have a GitHub account. They're constanly improving. Given this, you could probably do web dev on a tablet.
* **Pictures** : [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) has good quality CC pictures and a fast search bar :)
* **Drawing diagrams** : [draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio)
  You can self-host if you like by just forking it and setting up GitHub pages :O  

Try to fully explore all features of the listed tools before you decide you need some new tool. (Found out that some people call it "[Taco Bell Programming](http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html)".)

The defaults are usually pretty powerful and clean.

Have fun! ðŸ™‚
